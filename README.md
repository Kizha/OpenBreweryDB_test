# Java + REST Assured testing of Open Brewery DB

## Test Task
1) Cover "Search Breweries"
   1) Mostly all cases are covered.
2) Cover "List Breweries".
   1) I would be use several techniques of the testing design such as boundary value analysis (f.e. check 'per_page' parameter), equivalence partitioning (filter by 'by_city', 'country', etc.), error guessing (URL-encoding) and pairwise testing as we have a large amount of tests for filtering or sorting parameters.
   2) From my point of view this type of work will be done in 2-3 days.
